            <h3>The Engineering Student</h3>
            <p>I’m a natural leader. I’ve eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people.  I  find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I’m not in a leadership role because if I don’t know  the   answer, I’ll at least point them in the right direction. In my last two roles, I was promoted to leadership positions  after less  than a year with the company.</p>

            <h4>Become a web developer</h4>
            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can even teach any of my student who doesn't no what is HTML. I can teach them how to make a simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>
